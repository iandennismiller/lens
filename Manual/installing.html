    <h1>Getting Started: Installing Lens</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This explains how to install your own copy of Lens.  The procedures
      differ between <a href="#windows">Windows</a> and <a
	href="#unix">Unix/Mac OS X</a>.

      <a name="unix"></a>
    <h3>Installing Under Unix and Mac OS X</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To install Lens under Mac OS X, you will first need to
      install <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</a>, which
      will give you a Unix and X-windows emulation environment.  I
      can't give you much support where this is concerned.  Be sure to
      install the xfree* packages.  From here on in, I will assume you
      are running a Unix shell (xterm).
    
      <li>Make a Lens directory for yourself.  Why not call it "~/Lens".  Go
	there.<br>
	<b>mkdir ~/Lens<br>
        cd ~/Lens</b>

      <li><a href="Dist/lens.tar.gz">Download the complete
	  distribution, lens.tar.gz</a> into your new directory.
      <li>Untar the distribution.  If you have a smart version of tar, you can
	do this with:<br>
	<b>tar xvzf lens.tar.gz</b><br>
	If you have a dumb version of tar, you will need to do:<br>
	<b>zcat lens.tar.gz | tar xv</b><br>
      <li><b>rm lens.tar.gz</b><br>

      <li><b>mv Bin/i586 Bin/${HOSTTYPE}</b>
      <li>Next you need to compile the TclTk libraries for your machine.  If
      you're running on a Linux machine with glibc (the equivalent of RedHat
      6.0 or later), you may be in luck because the TclTk libraries are already
	compiled and you can go right to the next step.  If you have problems
	with shared libraries at the end of the Lens compilation, you should
	go back and compile your own TclTk libraries as follows:
	<ol>
	  <li><b>cd TclTk/tcl8.3.4/unix</b>
	  <li><b>rm config.cache</b>
	  <li>Linux: <b>./configure --enable-shared</b><br>
	  OS X: <b>./configure --disable-shared --disable-load</b>
	  <li><b>make</b>
	  <li>Pray that nothing bad happens.  If all went well, a new
	    <i>libtcl8.3.so</i> file should have been created.  There is a
	    chance a <i>libtcl8.3.a</i> was built instead.  If so <i>you
	      will not be using shared libraries</i>.  But that's ok.
	      If all didn't go well, I'm afraid I can't help you much.  
	      Start reading the README file.
	  <li>Remove the .o files we don't need anymore:<br>
	    <b>rm -f *.o</b>
	  <li><b>cd ../../tk8.3.4/unix</b>
	  <li><b>rm config.cache</b>
	  <li>Linux: <b>./configure --enable-shared --with-tcl=../../tcl8.3.4/unix</b><br>
	  OS X: <b>./configure --disable-shared --disable-load --with-tcl=../../tcl8.3.4/unix</b>
	  <li><b>make</b>
	  <li>Pray pray pray...and voilá you have a Tk library, maybe.
	  <li><b>rm -f *.o</b>
	  <li>Now you should move the two libraries to your Lens Bin directory:
	    <br>
	    <b>cd ~/Lens</b> (or wherever you installed it)<br>
	  <b>mv TclTk/tcl8.3.4/unix/libtcl8.3.* Bin/${HOSTTYPE}</b><br>
	  <b>mv TclTk/tk8.3.4/unix/libtk8.3.* Bin/${HOSTTYPE}</b><br>
	  <li>On OS X:<br>
          <b>ranlib Bin/${HOSTTYPE}/libtcl8.3.a</b><br>
          <b>ranlib Bin/${HOSTTYPE}/libtk8.3.a</b>
	</ol>
<h4>Compiling Lens</h4>

    <li>Go back to your Lens directory and take a look at the
      Makefile.  If you do not see a section at the top for your
      HOSTTYPE, you may need to add one and set it up appropriately.
      When compiling on Mac OS X, the HOSTTYPE should be "macintosh".
      If you are compiling on an Alpha, you should use
      "MACHINE=ALPHA".

      <li>Check to be sure the file /usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xlib.h
      exists. If it doesn't you will need to install the XFree86-devel
      RPM package that is appropriate for your version of Unix.  If
      you don't have the CDs you used to install your Unix in the
      first place, you may be able to find the package <a
      href="http://www.rpmfind.net">here</a>.

      <li>Now you're ready to compile.  So type:<br>
	<b>make all</b><br>
	This will compile <i>alens</i> and then <i>lens</i>.
      <li>If something went wrong, it is probably because you have funny
	C header files in your <i>/usr/include</i> or <i>/usr/include/sys</i>
	directories.  Try to fix this by:
	<ol>
	  <li>Creating a MACHINE_... definition for your machine in sysext.h.
	  <li>Inside of the test for your machine type in sysext.h,
	  #include any necessary header files, #define things to prevent bad
	  header files from being included, or #undef things that cause
          problems.

          <li>If you really can't figure it out, send the compile message to
          <a href=mailto:dr+lens@tedlab.mit.edu>Doug Rohde</a>.  He'll probably
          want a temporary account on your machine so he can take a look at
          your header files and test for byte ordering and such.
	</ol>

      <li>When everything builds correctly, you will have two executables,
      <i>lens</i> and <i>alens</i>, which are actually pointers to the real
      executables that sit in the <i>Bin/${HOSTTYPE}</i> directory.  Now
      you're ready to <a href="running.html">run Lens</a>.

      <li>If you ever want to recompile, you have to be careful whether the
      object files that aren't being changed are for the correct version
      (either <i>lens</i> or <i>alens</i>).  To compile only <i>alens</i>,
      do:</br><b>make alens</b></br> To compile only <i>lens</i>, do:<br>
      <b>make lens</b> or just <b>make</b><br> If you ever switch from
      compiling one to the other, always do:<br> <b>make clean</b><br> to
      remove the object files.
      <li>Be sure to read the section on <a href="running.html">Running
Lens</a> before you try to run it.  It won't work unless you set the right
environment variables.
    </ol>

    <a name="windows"></a>
    <h3>Installing Under Windows</h3>
    <ol>
      The first thing you will need to do is to install the Cygwin Utilities.
      These provide a Unix-like environment for Windows, including a shell,
      compiler, C libraries, and other goodies.
    <li>Download the latest Cygwin release from the <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin homepage</a>. 
    <li>To install the Cygwin stuff, just run the setup.exe program and follow
    the instructions.  It will take some time, especially if you have a slow
    internet connection.  When choosing packages for Cygwin, be sure to include
    Devel/gcc, Devel/make, Text/less, and Text/more.   
    <li>Now start up a Cygwin shell window.  They probably made an icon in your
    Start menu for just that purpose.
    <li>Make a Lens directory for yourself.  Why not call it "Lens".<br>
 	<b>mkdir Lens<br>
        cd Lens</b>
    <li><a href="Dist/lens-win.tar.gz">Download the complete windows
	  distribution, lens-win.tar.gz</a> into your new directory.  If
          Windows mangled the name, mutter offensive things about Emperor Gates 
          and rename it <b>lens-win.tar.gz</b>.
    <li><b>tar xvzf lens-win.tar.gz<br>
    rm lens-win.tar.gz</b>

    <li>If all you want is the plain Lens release.  You should be
ready to go.  Head straight to <a href="running.html">Running
Lens</a>.  If Lens seg faults when you try to run it, it is likely
that the precompiled binary is incompatible with your version of
Cygwin, and you will need to compile it yourself.

<h4>Compiling Lens</h4>
      If you're going to want to customize the source code, you'll need to be
      able to compile your own version of Lens.
    <li>Look for the file /usr/include/X11/Xlib.h.  If it isn't there, do
    this:
    <ol>
    <li><a href="Dist/xlib.tar.gz">Download this tar file</a>.

    <li>Be warned that when you untar this file it may write over some
    of the include files in your /usr/include/X11 directory.  If you
    don't want it to do this, leave off the P flag and then move the
    results by hand from the <b>usr</b> directory that will be
    created.

    <li><b>tar xvzfP xlib.tar.gz</b>
    </ol>

    <li>If you don't have one already, create a .bash_profile file in
    your Cygwin home directory.  In it, you should put:<br> <b>export
    HOSTTYPE=i686</b><br>
    And be sure to source that file or run that command before proceeding.
    <li>Now you're ready to compile.  So type:<br>
	<b>make all</b><br>
	This will compile <i>alens</i> and then <i>lens</i>.

    <li>If something went wrong, it may be because stuff in the Windows
    section of the Makefile needs to be changed.

      <li>When everything builds correctly, you will have two executables,
      <i>lens</i> and <i>alens</i>, which are actually pointers to the real
      executables that sit in the <i>Bin/</i> directory.  Now
      you're ready to <a href="running.html">run Lens</a>.

      <li>If you ever want to recompile, you have to be careful whether the
      object files that aren't being changed are for the correct version
      (either <i>lens</i> or <i>alens</i>).  To compile only <i>alens</i>,
      do:<br><b>make alens</b><br> To compile only <i>lens</i>, do:<br>
      <b>make lens</b> or just <b>make</b><br> If you ever switch from
      compiling one to the other, always do:<br> <b>make clean</b><br> to
      remove the object files.
      <li>Be sure to read the section on <a href="running.html">Running
Lens</a> before you try to run it.  It won't work unless you set the right
environment variables.

    </ol>

    <a name="newversion"></a>
    <h3>New Versions</h3> New versions of Lens appear every few months.  To
    keep up with things, you will need to download the new source code and
    recompile.  You don't need to download the full distribution, just the <a
    href="Dist/lens-src.tar.gz">lens-src.tar.gz</a> file.
   <p>
Untarring <b>this
    will overwrite the files</b> in your <i>Src/</i>, <i>Commands/</i>, and
    <i>Examples/</i> directories.  The only files it will not overwrite are
    Src/extension.c, Src/type.h, Src/sysext.h, and the Makefile.  For these
    files, it will write a ".default" file instead.
   <p>
    If you have not customized those files, rename the ".default" file to the
    same name without the ".default".  If you have made changes to those files and
the default file has changed (which should only happen rarely), you may need
to update your version or reimplement your changes in the default one.
<p>
If you have customized any files other than Src/extension.c, Src/type.h,
Src/sysext.h, and the Makefile, you should rename your copy before untarring
the lens-src.tar.gz or the files will be overwritten.  You may want to write a
script to do this so you don't forget.
    <p>
    There is a handy link to the source update distribution on the main Manual
page.

    <h3>Working Offline?</h3> If so, you may need to install a local version
    of the manual.  To do that, just <a href="Dist/lens-manual.tar.gz">grab a
    copy of this tar file</a>, put it in your Lens directory, and untar it.
    Then just load the file Manual/index.html in your web browser.  The search
    engine won't work, but you can always use <i>grep</i> once you have local
    copies of the files.
