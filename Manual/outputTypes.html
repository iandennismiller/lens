    <h1>Special Topics: Group Output Types</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The group output types form a pipeline of functions which compute the
      units' <i>output</i>s in the forward direction and backpropagate the
      <i>outputDeriv</i>s in the backward direction.  The basic types
      determine the output as a function of the input.  The clamping types set
      or alter the output based on the <i>externalInput</i>.  The other types
      modify an already-computed output value.  There shouldn't be more than
      one basic type.  There may be no basic type if there is a clamping type.

    <h3>Basic Output Types</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>LINEAR</dt>
      <dd>This simply copies the input to the output.
      <dt>LOGISTIC</dt>
      <dd>Computes the traditional sigmoid function:<br>
	<i>O = 1 / (1 + exp(-i * gain))</i><br>
	Gain is the inverse of the temperature.  It is used to avoid division.
	Ordinarily the gain is taken from the network's <i>gain</i> field or
	the group's <i>gain</i> field if that is set.  If ADAPTIVE_GAIN is
	used, each unit will have its own trainable gain.
      <dt>TERNARY</dt>
      <dd>This is essentially a normal sigmoid shifted to the right added to a
	negated sigmoid of <i>-i</i> shifted to the left.  Alternately, you can think
	of it as a [-1,1] sigmoid that has a flat place at 0.  It is designed
	to give the unit stable outputs at -1, 1, and 0.  You could think of
	such units as coding whether a feature is present, absent, or
	unknown.  The <i>gain</i> affects the slope of each of the two
	sigmoids.  The <i>ternaryShift</i> sets the distance between their
	centers.  Increasing the <i>ternaryShift</i> will make the central
	plateau wider.  Increasing the gain will make the transitions between
	plateaus sharper.
      <dt>TANH</dt>
      <dd>This is equivalent to <i>1 - 2S(2 i)</i>, where S is the ordinary
	sigmoid function and I is the input.  Note that its slope is actually
	twice what the slope would be if you just stretched a sigmoid to the 
	range [-1,1].  So you may want to use half the normal gain to
	compensate.  If ADAPTIVE_GAIN is used, each unit will have its own
	trainable gain.
      <dt>EXPONENTIAL</dt>
      <dd>This is just <i>exp(i)</i>.  There is a big potential for overflow
	with this, so you may want to be careful how you use it.
      <dt>GAUSSIAN</dt>
      <dd>This computes a gaussian radial basis function: <i>exp(-i^2 *
	  gain^2)</i>.  This is often as effective as LOGISTIC, although it
	can become a bit unstable at the end of training.  It can also be used
	in conjunction with ADAPTIVE_GAIN for individual, trainable gains for
	each unit.
      <dt>SOFT_MAX</dt>
      <dd>This is equivalent to an exponential followed by a normalization.
	However, SOFT_MAX scales the values before
	computing the exponential.  This doesn't affect the end result but it
	avoids overflow.  A SOFT_MAX OUTPUT group will get DIVERGENCE error by
	default.
      <dt>KOHONEN</dt>
      <dd>This is used for the map layer in a KOHONEN network.  It should be
	combined with a DISTANCE input function.  It finds the unit whose
	weight vector is most similar to the input vector.  Any unit in the
	map whose squared Euclidean distance from the best unit is greater
	than <i>neighborhood</i> will be silent.  Groups in the neighborhood
	will have output equal to 1.0 minus the ratio between the unit's input
	and the largest input of any unit.  The output will therefore fall in
	the range [0.0, 1.0].
	<p>
	  In the backward pass, the inputDeriv of units in the neighborhood
	  will be set to 1.0 and that of the others to 0.0.  Only units in the
	  neighborhood will be able to alter their incoming weights.  The
	  DISTANCE procedure, in the backward pass, will cause the incoming
	  weights to drift towards the input vector.

      <dt>OUT_BOLTZ</dt>
      <dd>This is used for groups in a Boltzmann network.  If the unit has an
	<i>externalInput</i>, the output will be clamped to that value.
	Otherwise, if it has a target and the network is in the gracePeriod
	(the positive phase of the Boltzmann algorithm), the output will be
	clamped to the target.  Otherwise, it is computed as a time-averaged
	sigmoid of the input.

      <dt>OUT_COPY</dt>
      <dd>The units in a group with an OUT_COPY output function simply copy
	their outputs from some field in the corresponding units of another
	group.  The <a href="Commands/copyConnect.html">copyConnect</a>
	command must be used to specify which group and which field will be
	the source of the copying.

      <dt>INTERACT_INTEGR</dt>
      <dd>This implements the interactive-activation output rule.  For a
	traditional interactive-activation model, it should be used with
	DOT_PRODUCT inputs, and an INCR_CLAMP input function.  It contains a
	decay term and time-averages the activations.  The decay is fixed at
	1.0.  This version crops the unit outputs to the range [0, maxOutput]
	because negative outputs are not normally used in an IA model.
    </dl>

    <h3>Clamping Output Types</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>HARD_CLAMP</dt>
      <dd>If the <i>externalInput</i> is a real number, this sets the output
	to the <i>externalInput</i>.  Otherwise it does nothing.
      <dt>BIAS_CLAMP</dt>
      <dd>This sets the output to the initOutput (defaults to 1.0 for BIAS groups).
      <dt>ELMAN_CLAMP</dt>
      <dd>In order for an ELMAN_CLAMP function to work, you must first use <a
	  href="Commands/elmanConnect.html">elmanConnect</a> to associate a
	source group with the context group.  This simply copies the
	(cached) output from each source unit and adds it to the output of the
	corresponding context unit.

	It is possible to have more that one ELMAN_CLAMP function.  In this
	case, the output will simply sum the outputs from each of the source
	units.  If a group has multiple ELMAN_CLAMP functions, each call to
	elmanConnect will define the source group for the first function that
	has not yet been assigned a group.

      <dt>WEAK_CLAMP</dt>
      <dd>This shifts the output a certain fraction of the way towards the
	<i>externalInput</i>.  The fraction is determined by the
	<i>clampStrength</i>.  Specifically, the function is:
	<i>o = o + clampStrength * (externalInput - o)</i>
    </dl>

    <h3>Output Modifying Types</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>OUT_INTEGR</dt>
      <dd>This is just like IN_INTEGR but it integrates the output rather than
	the input.  This is put on by default in a CONTINUOUS network unless
	IN_INTEGR is specified.
      <dt>OUT_NORM</dt>
      <dd>This normalizes the outputs of the units in the group to sum to
	1.0.  It probably should not be used unless the un-normalized values 
	are constrained to be positive.  The SOFT_MAX function should be used
	rather than an EXPONENTIAL followed by OUT_NORM because SOFT_MAX will
	avoid numerical overflow.
      <dt>OUT_NOISE</dt>
      <dd>This makes the output noisy.  The type of noise is determined by
	the group's <i>noiseProc</i> and <i>noiseRange</i> parameters.
      <dt>OUT_DERIV_NOISE</dt>
      <dd>This injects noise into the <i>outputDeriv</i>s on the backward
	pass.  The type of noise is determined by
	the group's <i>noiseProc</i> and <i>noiseRange</i> parameters.
      <dt>OUT_CROPPED</dt>
      <dd>This crops the output to within the range [<i>minOutput</i>, 
	<i>maxOutput</i>].  You may want to use this after OUT_NOISE to
	prevent outputs outside of this range.
      <dt>OUT_WINNER</dt>
      <dd>This is a winner-take-all filter.  The most active unit retains its
	activation and the other units are set to the minimum output value
        for the group.  In the backward phase, the original outputs are 
        restored to enable error to be backpropagated across the transfer
	function.
