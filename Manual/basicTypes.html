    <h1>Special Topics: Basic Group Types</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <h3>Fixed Types</h3>
    <p>
      The <i>fixed type</i> is the primary type of the units in a group.  The
      main effect of the fixed type is that it determines the default input,
      output, and cost functions of the group.  The process of determining
      default functions can be fairly complicated as it depends on network
      type and other group types.  So if you don't want to figure it all out,
      you may want to just check the types of your groups with the <a
      href="Commands/groupType.html">groupType</a> command to make sure types
      are assigned as you expect and then explicitly specify them as
      necessary.
    <p>
      Note that there is no HIDDEN type.  A hidden group simply has no fixed
      type.  The default input type for a hidden group is DOT_PRODUCT.  The
      default output type is LOGISTIC.  However, if the network is a BOLTZMANN
      net, the default input type is IN_BOLTZ and the default output type is
      OUT_BOLTZ.  Hidden groups will automatically receive an incoming link
      from the bias unit.  This can be prevented with the -BIASED type, as
      explained below.

    <dl>
      <dt>BIAS</dt>
      <dd>A bias group is one that always maintains an output of 1.0 (or
      whatever the initOutput is set to).
	Ordinarily, a bias group will be created automatically with the
	network and there is probably no need for more than one, so you may
	never need to use this type.  BIAS cannot be combined with any other
	fixed type.  A BIAS group by default is itself unbiased, has no
	input type, and has a BIAS_CLAMP output type.  The BIAS_CLAMP function
	simply sets the output to the group's initOutput.
      <dt>INPUT</dt>
      <dd>The main implication of the INPUT type is that <i>externalInput</i>s
	will be assigned to units in the group when an example event is loaded.
	Any group which is expecting external inputs should be
	of type INPUT.  If the <i>externalInput</i> is NaN, the input group
	should act like any other group, computing the inputs based on
	incoming connections and computing the output with ordinary output
	functions.
	<p>
	  However, it is usually the case that input groups will always have
	  external inputs.  Therefore, to save processing time there is no
	  default input type for an INPUT group and there are no bias inputs
	  created by default.  If no <a
	  href="outputTypes.html">basic output type</a> is specified and no
	  clamping output type is specified and there is not a SOFT_CLAMP
	  input type, a HARD_CLAMP output function will be prepended to the
	  output types of an INPUT group.  If a SOFT_CLAMP input type is
	  specified, the default output type is LOGISTIC.
      <dt>OUTPUT</dt>
      <dd>The main implication of the OUTPUT type is that <i>target</i>s
	will be assigned to units in the group when an example event is
	loaded.  These groups are treated the same as hidden groups.  However,
	OUTPUT groups will also be assigned a default error function.
	Groups with KOHONEN or OUT_BOLTZ output functions will have no default
	error procedure.  LINEAR groups will have SUM_SQUARED error.  SOFT_MAX
	groups will have DIVERGENCE error.  All other groups will have
	CROSS_ENTROPY 
	as their default error function.  OUTPUT groups in CONTINUOUS networks
	have a STANDARD_CRIT criterion function by default.
	<p>
	  The OUTPUT type may be combined with the INPUT or ELMAN types
	  (although the latter doesn't really make much sense).  If a group
	  has multiple types, the default functions will be assigned as if it
	  were just an OUTPUT group.

      <dt>ELMAN</dt>
      <dd>The ELMAN type can be used to identify context groups in simple
	recurrent networks.  Like BIAS and INPUT groups, ELMAN groups have no
	default bias inputs and no default input function.  The default output
	function is ELMAN_CLAMP.  Before an ELMAN_CLAMPED group is functional,
	you must use <a href="Commands/elmanConnect.html">elmanConnect</a> to
	assign a source group to it.
    </dl>

    <h3>Group Criterion Functions</h3>
    Criterion functions are used to determine when the outputs of an OUTPUT
    group are good enough to either stop training or to continue to the next
    event in the example.  They can also be used when testing the network to
    determine the number of examples on which it is correct.  When training,
    the <i>groupCriterion</i> defaults to the network's <i>trainGroupCrit</i>,
    but can be overridden by the group's <i>trainGroupCrit</i>.  When testing,
    the <i>testGroupCrit</i> is used.  There are separate values for training
    and testing because you may want to, for example, use the criterion when
    testing but not when training.
    <dl>
      <dt>STANDARD_CRIT</dt>
      <dd>This criterion is true if the absolute difference between the output
	and target of each unit is less than the <i>groupCriterion</i>.  Units
	with NaN targets are ignored.
      <dt>MAX_CRIT</dt>
      <dd>This criterion is true if the unit with the largest target is also
	the most active unit and the difference between the output and target
	is less 
	than the <i>groupCriterion</i>.  Units with NaN targets
	are ignored.
    </dl>
    
    <h3>History Parameters</h3>
    Ordinarily, the <i>inputHistory</i> and <i>outputHistory</i> arrays are
    allocated for every unit but the <i>targetHistory</i> is only allocated
    for groups with error functions and the <i>outputDerivHistory</i> is only
    allocated for groups with some cost type.  However, when writing your own
    code, it may be useful to have the latter two arrays allocated anyway, to
    be used for your own purposes.  These flags will force them to be built.
    Also, to save time the history arrays will only be filled in when
    necessary during training or testing.  You can use these flags to force
    the arrays to be used.
    <dl>
      <dt>USE_INPUT_HIST</dt>
      <dd>Forces the <i>inputHistory</i> to be written when the unit inputs
	are computed.
      <dt>USE_OUTPUT_HIST</dt>
      <dd>Forces the <i>outputHistory</i> to be written when the unit outputs
	are computed.
      <dt>USE_TARGET_HIST</dt>
      <dd>Forces the <i>targetHistory</i> to be allocated and written when the
	cost is computed.
      <dt>USE_OUT_DERIV_HIST</dt>
      <dd>Forces the <i>outputDerivHistory</i> to be allocated and written
	when the unit output derivatives are computed.
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Noise Types</h3>
    Most noise types are classified as either input or output types.  However,
    two forms of noise don't fit into the standard pipelines.
    
    <dl>
      <dt>DERIV_NOISE</dt>
      <dd>This injects noise on the derivatives of incoming links to the group
	just before each weight update.  There is currently no way to specify
	exactly which type of links are to be affected.
      <dt>EXT_INPUT_NOISE</dt>
      <dd>This injects noise to the external inputs when they are loaded from
	the example event.  This differs from INPUT_NOISE in that input noise
	changes every tick but this remains constant across the event.
    </dl>

    <h3>Other Types</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>BIASED</dt>
      <dd>If this is on, the units in the group will receive incoming links
	from the bias unit when they are created.  This only has an effect
	when the group is created.  This defaults to off for BIAS, INPUT, and
	ELMAN groups and to on for HIDDEN and OUTPUT groups.
      <dt>RESET_ON_EXAMPLE</dt>
      <dd>If this is on, the outputs of units in the group will be reset to
	the <i>initOutput</i> at the start of each example and any integrating
	information reset.  This defaults to on for CONTINUOUS networks and
	to off for other networks.
      <dt>ADAPTIVE_GAIN</dt>
      <dd>If this is on, units using a LOGISTIC, TANH, or GAUSSIAN output
        function will train their <i>gain</i> parameter along with the incoming
	weights.  The <i>adaptiveGainRate</i> is the learning rate for the
	gain changes.  Steepest descent is always used.  When the network is
    reset, unit gains will be set to the group or network default.

      <dt>WRITE_OUTPUTS</dt>
      <dd>When the unit activations and targets are written to the activation
	output file, which is opened with <a
	  href="Commands/openNetOutputFile.html">openNetOutputFile</a>
	command, only groups with this type will have their values written.
	This type is added by default to OUTPUT groups, because those are the
	groups whose activations one is usually interested in.
      <dt>LESIONED</dt>
      <dd>This is turned on if any unit in the group is lesioned.  This makes
	it slower to traverse the units in the group because it must check
	each unit and avoid the lesioned ones.  The user can't set this group
	type. 
      <dt>FROZEN</dt>
      <dd>This is turned on if the group is frozen and thus no weight updates
	will be performed on incoming links to the group.   The user can't set
	this group type.  
    </dl>
